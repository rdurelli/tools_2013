The objective is to compare the effort of reusing frameworks by using a conventional technique with by using a model-based technique. 
 The Persistence CF briefly presented in Section~\ref{CFF} played the role of ``study subject'' and it was used in both reuse techniques (conventional and model-based). 
 The quantitative focus was determined considering the time spent in conducting the reuse process and the qualitative focus was to determine which technique takes less effort during reuse process. 
 This experiment was conducted from the perspective of application engineers reusing CFs and the study object is the `effort' to perform a CF reuse.
