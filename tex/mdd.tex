According to Griswold's experiments programmers tends to not only commit syntactic errors an behave inconsistently, they usually ignore the global impact of the changes they make during the restructuring process. Moreover, he also argues that manual restructuring is an error-prone and expensive activity~\cite{grisswold}. Therefore, software engineers have applied Model-Driven Development (MDD) technologies to software restructuring to deal with those limitations and to automatize the software restructuring. MDD consists of the combination of generative programming, domain-specific languages and model transformations. It also aims to reduce the semantic gap between the program domain and the implementation, using high-level models that shield software developers from complexities of the underlying implementation platform~\cite{France:2007:MDC:1253532.1254709}.
