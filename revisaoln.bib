  abstract = {Research in Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) has brought
	up powerful abstractions in order to specify under which conditions
	an aspect affects the base software. So far, Model-Driven Development
	(MDD) approaches to AOSD have mostly concentrated on the weaving
	process and, as a result, they have come up with manifold ways to
	compose aspect models and base models. All too often, however, the
	approaches disregard the benefits that the aspect-oriented abstractions
	can bring to software development, though. This paper discusses the
	implications that such negligence has on the specification of aspect-oriented
	models in MDD. Furthermore, it presents a weaver that is able to
	cope with sophisticated join point selection abstractions, as they
	are known from many aspect-oriented programming languages, and which
	go far beyond the selection capabilities provided by current model
	weavers. By means of this weaver, models can realize both a higher
	separation of concerns as well as a higher level of abstraction.

  abstract = {AMFIBIA is a meta-model that formalizes the essential aspects and
	concepts of business process modelling. Though AMFIBIA is not the
	first approach to formalizing the aspects and concepts of business
	process modelling, it is more ambitious in the following respects:
	First, it is independent from particular modelling formalisms of
	business processes and it is designed in such a way that any formalisms
	for modelling some aspect of a business process can be plugged into
	AM-FIBIA. Therefore, AMFIBIA is formalism-independent. Second it
	is not biased toward any aspect of business process and the different
	aspects can be, basically, considered and modelled independently
	of each other. Moreover, it is not restricted to a fixed set of aspects;
	further aspects of business processes can be easily integrated. Third,
	AMFIBIA does not only name and relate the concepts of business process
	modelling, as it is typically done in ontologies or architectures
	for business process modelling. Rather, AMFIBIA also captures the
	interaction among the different aspects and concepts, and therefore
	fully defines the dynamic behaviour of a business process model,
	with its different aspects modelled in different notations. To prove
	this claim, we implemented a prototype of a formalism-independent
	workflow engine based on AMFIBIA: This workflow engine, also called
	AMFIBIA, is open for new aspects of business process modelling and
	new modelling formalisms can be added to it. In this paper, we will
	present AMFIBIA and the prototype workflow engine based on this meta-model
	and discuss the principles and concepts of its design.},

  abstract = {Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is an emerging paradigm that enhances
	the modularity of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by eliminating
	tangling and scattering in the code. The scattering code is encapsulated
	within a module called an Aspect. A join point is an execution point
	in a program. When there is more than one aspect sharing the same
	join point then it becomes necessary to identify the faults that
	occur during their composition. A Fault model is instrumental in
	identifying the faults that can occur in any software system. Research
	works so far have focused on the composition of Aspects only from
	the implementation standpoint. It is necessary to identify these
	faults during the design process, early in the software development
	lifecycle. This would help in adopting better coding strategies that
	result in modular, reusable and maintainable code. Towards this objective,
	this paper proposes a candidate fault model that identifies the faults
	which occur during Aspect Composition from the design. Use-case scenarios
	and sequence diagrams are used to reflect the design of the system.
	The proposed fault model identifies the faults from the sequence
	diagrams. Test cases are generated from the design using black-box
	testing strategy. The proposed fault model is also applied to an
	illustrative case study and has been validated using test case coverage

	A higher level of abstraction is needed in order to capture the interactions

	With the AIC we foresee the ability to capture aspect interactions
	at a joinpoint in a common specification in the form of use-case
	scenarios, and the ability to execute these scenarios while non-invasively
	manipulating the interactions among the various aspects. In addition

	has reached a complexity that requires software engineers to revisit
	the principle of separation of concerns [5]. Traditional software
	organization has been performed along some form of functional decomposition.
	Different paradigms and languages support the implementation, and
	composition of sub-parts into whole systems through the availability
	of some modular unit of functionality (component). In essence, traditional
	software decomposition and current programming languages have been
	mutually supportive [4]. At the same time, separation of concerns
	can only be beneficial if the different concerns can be effectively
	composed to produce the overall system. The OOP paradigm seems to
	work well only if the problem to be solved can be described with
	relatively simple interfaces among objects. Unfortunately, this is
	not the case when we move from sequential programming to concurrent
	programming where the component interaction violates simple object
	interfaces. One of the reasons behind this is the inherent structure
	of today's software systems that conceptually does not lead itself
	to a safe decomposition. As a result, the benefits associated with
	OOP no longer hold. Component interactions limit reuse and make it
	difficult to validate the design and correctness of software systems.
	Reengineering of these systems is needed in order to meet future
	changes in requirements. This component interaction is based on a
	number of properties that affect the semantics or the performance
	of the system and do not localize well in one modular unit, but tend
	to cut-across groups of components resulting in a ``code tangling''
	[4]. Example cross-cutting properties (or aspects) include synchronization,
	scheduling, and fault tolerance. This code tangling destroys modularity,
	making the source code difficult to develop and difficult to understand.
	It also limits reuse, making the source code difficult to evolve.
	It further makes programs more error prone. In essence, it destroys
	the quality of the software. In [1] the authors refer to these phenomena
	as ``composition anomalies''. This composition anomaly requires a
	shift in the methodologies used to separate concerns. In conjunction
	with modular composition, adaptability and reuse remain major issues
	to be considered while building complex software systems. Aspect-Oriented
	Programming (AOP) [4] is an emerging methodology that addresses components
	and aspects at the analysis and design phase of the software life-cycle,
	using mechanisms to compose them at the implementation level with
	a growing number of different technologies.},

	available for information systems requirements specification. However,
	piecing up all the details required for the production of a high
	quality use case can be a daunting task, especially for students
	and novice requirements professionals. This paper presents an approach
	aiming at reducing the time required for the elaboration of high
	quality use case specifications. The basis of the approach is to
	write a use case text using the composition of set of pre-defined
	fragments, where each fragment represents a recurring set of interactions
	required to achieve a sub-goal. Each fragment can then be customized
	to meet use case goals. Since each fragment is coded using the best
	practices for writing use case steps, both the fragment text and
	the final use case text will be well composed. We believe that this
	approach will allow novice requirements professional to write high
	quality use cases in less time than it would be necessary using the
	other approaches. Our experience on writing use cases for business
	information systems using a catalogue of use case fragments suggested
	that they can be a facilitator in several aspects, not only improving
	the writing speed, but also leading to standardization and concision

	problem. That is, models to-be-composed may conflict with each other

	resolving conflicts is a highly-intensive manual activity. In this
	paper, we investigate whether aspect-orientation reduces conflict
	resolution effort as improved modularization may better localize
	conflicts. The main goal of the paper is to conduct an exploratory
	study to analyze the impact of aspects on conflict resolution. In
	particular, model compositions are used to express the evolution
	of architectural models along six releases of a software product
	line. Well-known composition algorithms, such as override, merge
	and union, are applied and compared on both AO and non-AO models
	in terms of their conflict rate and effort to solve the identified

	a primary model. An aspect describes how a single objective is addressed
	in a design, and a primary model describes how core functionality
	requirements are addressed. In order to analyze the interactions
	between aspects and primary models they must be composed. System
	developers may need to create and analyze alternative realizations
	in order to produce a design that balances competing objectives (concerns).
	Treating realizations of design objectives as aspects allows developers
	to more easily swap in and out alternative realizations in a design.
	The iterative nature of design dictates that composition and analysis
	be carried out in a flexible and intuitive manner. Composing aspects
	and primary models can produce designs with conflicting structures
	or behaviors. We have developed a twolevel structure of composition
	constraints to address this issue; a high level that identifies the
	aspects and determines the order in which they will be composed (composition
	strategy), and a lower level that constrains how a single aspect
	is composed with a primary model (composition directives). In this
	paper we describe a model composition approach that utilizes composition
	constraints. We illustrate the approach using small examples of security
	and faulttolerance aspects.},

	communities, has focused on understanding the potential and limitations
	of various composition techniques. This has led to a large amount
	of proposals for alternative composition techniques, including many
	variations of message dispatch, inheritance, and aspect mechanisms.
	This paper makes the case that there is no single perfect composition
	technique that suits every situation, since different techniques
	incur different trade-offs. The proper composition technique to use
	depends on the particular design problem and its requirements (e.g.
	w.r.t. adaptability, reusability, understandability, robustness,
	etc. of the various elements of the design). However, most programming
	languages limit the available composition techniques to a very few.
	To address this, we propose a novel composition model. The model
	provides dedicated abstractions that can be used to express a wide
	variation of object composition techniques ("composition operators").
	Examples include various forms of inheritance, delegation, and aspects.
	The proposed model unifies objects (with encapsulated state and a
	message interface) and composition operators; composition operators
	are specified as first-class citizens. Multiple composition operators
	can be combined within the same application, and composition operators
	can even be used to compose new composition operators from existing
	ones. This opens new possibilities for developing domain-specific
	composition operators, taxonomies of composition operators, and for
	reuse and refinement of composition operators. To validate and experiment
	with the proposed model, we have designed and implemented a simple
	language, that we also use in this paper to show concrete examples.},

	[3] operates at a coarser granularity level and its reduced number

  abstract = {Aspect-oriented requirements engineering emerged to deal with crosscutting
	requirements. There are several aspect-oriented requirements approaches,
	such as Theme and MATA. Through the Theme approach, one can identify
	a set of actions associated to verbs present in requirements documentation,
	which are then analyzed in order to identify crosscutting behaviors,
	i.e., potential aspectual scenarios. However, the Theme's composition
	mechanism is not expressive enough even when dealing with analysis
	models. The MATA approach can overlap this point with its powerful
	composition mechanisms, based on graph transformations that use \textsc{UML}
	models, in particular behavioral models. These models express scenarios
	that constitute a very popular and used technique to specify a system's
	behavior. Although, MATA is well-succeeded approach to specify aspectual
	behavior, it does not provide enough mechanisms to identify (aspectual)
	scenarios. Also, it does not identify negative scenarios, i.e., unexpected
	situations, making their treatment more manageable using aspect-orientation.
	All these scenarios could be identified with Theme and refined with
	MATA. This paper describes an approach that can be seen as a synergy
	between these two complementary techniques, where identification,
	modularization, specification and composition of aspectual behavior
	is realized in a seamless and systematic way.},

	with the primary \textsc{UML} model of the system under development.
	For performance analysis we use techniques developed previously in

	with the standard \textsc{UML} Profile for Schedulability, Performance
	and Time (SPT), and transform them first into Core Scenario Model
	(CSM) and then into different performance models. The contribution
	of this paper is in performing the composition of the aspects with
	the primary model at the CSM level. The input is represented by the
	primary model and a number of aspect models in \textsc{UML}+SPT,
	which are processed as follows: a) converted separately to CSM; b)
	composed into a single CSM model; c) transformed into a Layered Queueing
	Networks (LQN) model and d) analyzed. The proposed approach is illustrated
	with a case study based on two standards, TPC-W and SSL.},

	We show that composition of several such weavings is however not
	compositional as it does not preserve semantics. In particular, weavings
	must consider that other weavings have already been applied. This
	explains why it is considerably more difficult to reason about multiple

	such a design improves the conceptual integrity of the programming

	To support these claims, we present the design and implementation

	as the basic unit of modularity. We show that Eos-U supports layered
	designs in which classpects separate integration concerns flexibly

	part of the software development effort. The good news is that most
	of them appear time and again during system development and, luckily,
	their solutions can be often described as a pattern independently
	from any specific application or domain. A proof of this are the
	current application servers and middleware platforms that can provide
	configurable prebuilt services for managing some of these crosscutting
	concerns, or aspects. Nevertheless, these reusable pattern solutions
	presents two shortcomings, among others: (1) they need to be applied
	manually; and (2) most of these pattern solutions do not use aspect-orientation,
	and, since NFRs are often crosscutting concerns, this leads to scattered
	and tangled representations of these concerns. Our approach aims
	to overcome these limitations by: (1) using model-driven techniques
	to reduce the development effort associated to systematically apply
	reusable solutions for satisfying NFRs; and (2) using aspect-orientation
	to improve the modularization of these crosscutting concerns. Regarding
	the first contribution, since the portion of a system related to
	NFRs is usually significant, the reduction on the development effort
	associated to these NFRs is also significant. Regarding the second
	contribution, the use aspect-orientation improves maintenance and
	evolution of the non-functional requirements that are managed as
	aspects. An additional contribution of our work is to define a mapping
	and transition from aspectual requirements to aspect-oriented software
	architectures, which, in turn, contributes to improve the general
	issue of systematically relating requirements to architecture. Our
	approach is illustrated by applying it to a Toll Gate case study.},

	need to collect all data that is necessary to detect dynamic join
	points, and they need to maintain that data in appropriate data structures.
	In order to ease this step, it is desirable to translate JPDDs into

  abstract = {Aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) techniques have been advocated as solutions
	to support separation of crosscutting features from other application
	design concerns. In an AOM approach, crosscutting features are described
	by aspect models and other application features are described by
	a primary model [1]. However, composing an aspect model with a primary
	model can result in conflicts or compromised behaviors. Therefore,
	a key issue in applying the AOM approach is determining whether composition
	of an aspect model and a primary model produces a composed model
	that has desired properties. We extend the previous aspect composition
	approaches by France et al. [1] and Song et al. [2] by supporting
	a way to generate proof obligations that must be discharged in order
	to establish that a desired property holds in the composed class
	model. Fig. 1 shows an overview of our verifiable composition approach.
	The composition of a primary model class diagram and an aspect model
	class diagram (refer to the action (1) in Fig. 1) is accomplished
	according to a named-based composition proposed by [1]. Specifying
	the given property statement using the Object Constraint Language
	(OCL) provides the property to be verified denoted as Pprop (refer
	to (2)). The operation behavior in a composed model needs to be verified
	against this property. A proof obligation is generated and evaluated
	when a sequence diagram is derived from the operation specification
	in the composed class diagram (refer to (3)). If any faulty composition
	is notified during the evaluation, the current sequence diagram,
	which is partially derived at that point, and the current proof obligation
	may be used to determine at which part of the composition the property
	fails to hold. The information that is available when the composition
	stops, can be used by a developer to determine what needs to be done
	to correct the situation. Otherwise, a sequence diagram is obtained.
	For details of the action (3) in Fig. 1, refer to our earlier work
	in [3].},

	reflective middleware substrate in such a way that it can be dynamically

	when it is not used. Our AOP approach involves aspects that can be
	dynamically (un)weaved across a distributed system on the basis of
	pointcut expressions that are inherently distributed in nature, and
	it supports the composition of advice that is remote from the advised

	the dependency inversion and stable dependencies principles, a pointcut
	interface should expose only stable abstractions in order to maximally

	In this paper, we propose a domain-driven architecture method for

	reengineering of use case models to discover stable abstractions
	that are anchored in the domain model of the application. During
	architecture design, these stable domain abstractions are mapped
	to pointcut interfaces. As part of this mapping activity, the architecture
	is constrained to ensure that the pointcut interfaces can be implemented
	correctly.
	
	
	We have applied this method in two applications, where we validate
	that pointcut interfaces can be reused for implementing the composition
	logic of different aspects without requiring modification to their
	pointcut signatures. Moreover, the method consistently yields pointcut
	interface hierarchies.},

	for brainstorming potential attacks and their mitigations. Furthermore,
	the use of aspects allows mitigations to be maintained separately

A Crosscutting Framework Family (CFF) is a set of features whose composition results in a CF. As CFs encapsulate just one CC, their usefulness occurs when there are a number of them available for being reused. However, despite the number of CFs proposed in the last years, there is no a suitable repository in which they can be uploaded and made available. Furthermore, most of them employ white-box strategies in their reuse process, requiring significant technical knowledge to reuse them. To cope with these problems, we put forward the CrossFIRE, which is an infrastructure that allows to store, search, view and reuse CFs. Thus, domain engineers can make their CFFs available and the application engineers can search this repository, select the CFF features and reuse them in a model-based fashion.",
